🎓 EdStudio is an entity managed by [Enzo Degraeve](EnzoDeg40).

🎯 Our objective is to offer a solution open source for chatting online in a secure way, by offering people themselves to manage their encryption keys in order to guarantee that messages are encrypted from end to end.

📚 We are open to any contribution, whether you are a developer, system admin or security expert. Some repositories are not yet open to the public. If you want to contribute, you can contact Enzo by Telegram [@EnzoDeg40](https://t.me/EnzoDeg40).
